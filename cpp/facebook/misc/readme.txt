The subject line of the email must exactly match the puzzle keyword. Failure to do so means your 
submission will not be evaluated. Submissions are evaluated and the results emailed back every four hours.

If you have a Facebook account, send your submission from the same email address you login to Facebook, 
or we may not be able to find you!

The actual text body of the email will be ignored for grading purposes. Make sure all solution materials 
are attachments (see below).

Your solution must build or supply an executable file/script whose name is exactly the same as the 
puzzle keyword (case-sensitive). You do not have to worry about file permissions for the main 
executable, they will be checked and/or set for you.

You may compress/archive your solution files with tar or zip. The file extensions of these archives 
must be .zip, .tar, .tar.gz, .tgz, or .tar.bz2. If you compress your solution, only submit one compressed file.
If you compressed your solution, any Makefile/build.xml files (and the executable file itself) need to 
be uncompressed and/or built into the same root directory as the compressed archive itself or your 
submission will result in a build error.

If your solutions uses one of the compiled languages, it must be buildable using either GNU Make 3.81 or 
Ant 1.7.0 using the commands make or ant from the root directory where your submission is stored. You must 
supply your own makefiles or build.xml files.

You may assume the compilers are within the execution environment's path. The interpreted scripting 
languages have been installed in both /usr/bin and /usr/local/bin (the only exceptions are /bin/bash 
and /bin/sh)

If you make a mistake in your submission, you may send another email. Prior incorrect or malformed 
submissions will not be counted against you.

For extra credit, you may submit additional solutions in different languages. Submit each solution as a 
separate email. Every solution must be implemented in a language from the provided list.
