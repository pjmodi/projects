<h2>Corpspeak Lexicon</h2>

<p>To help retain my sanity while I worked at <a
href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.oracle.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.oracle.com/'" tppabs="http://www.oracle.com/">Oracle</a> I amused myself by culling
industry- and job-related words and phrases from the mouths and email
of my coworkers. (Of late, the corpspeak level at vivid has been "trending up" as well.)
I present them here for your enjoyment.

<p>Many of these terms are in ordinary English usage, but take on
slightly different meanings or are used with much greater frequency
(sometimes in an epithetic way) in corpspeak.

<p>The word '<i>foo</i>' is a metasyntactic variable; that is,
<i>foo</i> can be replaced by any other word (usually a noun).

<p>Please note the ubiquitous verbification of nouns, and (to a lesser
degree) nounification of verbs. Also note word coinage through
hyphenation ('<i>foo</i>-based') and root mutation
('<i>foo</i>-centric').

<p>Words with bracketed numbers as their definitions may be glossed
according to the following key:

<ol>

<a name = "1"><li> Modify any noun with this word to make it more
saleable. Otherwise meaningless.</a>

<a name = "2"><li> I don't know what this word means.</a>

</ol>
