<h2>Hack Technology and Matte-Black Technology in <i>Terminator 2</i></h2>

<p>The world of James Cameron's <i>Terminator 2</i> is a dystopia of 
nuclear holocaust and the near-extermination of the human race. The 
film posits this fictional future as a consequence of the development 
of ever-higher technology, especially artificial intelligence. At the 
same time, the film's heroes make use of technology to defeat the 
technological threats, problematizing the anti-technology theme of 
the movie. Both the good guys and the bad guys use technology to 
accomplish their projects, but they use different technologies and use 
them in different ways. We can divide the realm of high technology 
into two subsets: "matte-black" technology--sleek, inscrutable, 
cutting-edge, brand-name technology; and "hack" technology--the 
technology of hobbyists: black-market, modified, functional, and 
ugly. In <i>Terminator 2</i>, these two forms of technology are aligned 
along (and also define) a dichotomy between authority figures and 
renegades; figures of authority use matte-black technology, but 
renegades use hack tech.

<p>The renegades in <i>Terminator 2</i> are the good guys--John Connor, 
Sarah Connor, and the T101 Terminator--and their technology is hack 
technology. In the scenes in which John Connor is introduced, we see 
him listening to Guns 'n' Roses, disobeying his parents, working on 
his dirtbike, and robbing an ATM. He is characterized as a rebellious 
teenager, intelligent and technically knowledgeable but 
undisciplined. John works in hack technologies, using them as 
instruments of his revolt. When his foster mother tells him to clean 
his room, he responds by turning up his tape player. He tunes and 
repairs his dirtbike, working "under the hood," and revs the bike's 
engine to drown out his foster father's admonitions. He robs the ATM 
with a jury-rigged computer device, undermining the matte-black 
technology represented by the ATM, a portal into the authoritarian 
world of finance and financial accountability. By subverting the 
technology of authority, John subverts the body of authority itself, 
defining himself simultaneously as hacker and renegade.

<p>Sarah Connor is also a rebel: a guerrilla fighter, a mental 
patient, and a hack technologist. To keep in shape while incarcerated, 
she upends her bed frame as a chin-up bar. She manages her escape 
from the mental institution with a paper clip, secreted away and 
modified to suit the task of unlocking her restraints. And when she 
takes Dr. Silberman hostage, she threatens him with a syringe full of 
drain solvent--she adapts pieces of found technology into a weapon. 
On the other hand, Sarah's captors (the doctors and orderlies in the 
mental hospital) empower their authority and control the patients 
with matte-black technology. They use pharmaceuticals, video 
cameras and videotape, and the maze of hallways and locked doors 
in the asylum to support their jurisdiction. Later in the film, we see 
that Sarah has sequestered an arsenal of old weapons and vehicles 
near the Mexican border, in preparation for whatever battles she and 
John may need to fight. This desert outpost is a hack landscape, 
littered with broken machinery that has been plundered for parts.

<p>Miles Dyson begins the film as a matte-black technologist, but 
turns hacker by the end. He is characterized as an upper-middle-
class family man, a dedicated worker. His office at CyberDyne is a 
landscape of technology which complements the desert compound. It 
is filled with surveillance equipment, complicated double-key locks, 
keypads and keycodes--the instruments of authoritative control. 
When he, John and Sarah, and the T101 go to the CyberDyne office to 
destroy the lab, his matte-black technology fails him, as his key-card 
stops working after the silent alarm has been tripped. But the 
Terminator is ready with hack technology: saying "Let me try mine," 
he blows open the vault door with a grenade launcher. Later in the 
film, as Dyson dies of his gunshot wounds, he performs a 
quintessential hack by using a piece of his destroyed prototype 
processor (which is, in fact, matte-black) to set off the improvised 
explosives and destroy the lab, recycling the remains of a technology 
and improvising a new function for them.

<p>The clearest example of the distinction between matte-black 
and hack technology can be found in the two Terminators. In 
<i>Terminator 2</i>, the T101 is old technology, last year's model. He has 
been stolen and modified, reprogrammed by the resistance group of 
the future, converted from a SkyNet-controlled killer into John 
Connor's protector. This Terminator is characterized in the visual 
language of anti-authority: he dresses up as a biker, rides a 
motorcycle, and wears dark glasses, to the tune of "Bad to the Bone." 
He likes big guns, and he's not afraid to fire them at police officers. 
He breaks things, he transgresses boundaries, he does what is 
necessary to execute his program. In the scene in which John Connor 
calls his foster mother on a pay phone, the T101 smashes the coin 
box to get a quarter for John, flouting the societal mechanisms of 
commerce and security, and exemplifying the expediency of hack 
technology, in this case himself.

<p>The T1000, on the other hand, is a cutting-edge design, an 
"advanced prototype," as the T101 tells John. He is sent by SkyNet, 
the body of authority in the future, and in the present he assumes 
only roles of authority with his mimetic capabilities: the police 
officer, John's foster mother, the guard in the mental hospital, and 
finally Sarah herself, who has a position of authority as John's 
mother. As compared to the T101, the T1000 works stealthily and 
quietly, with an aesthetic grace and smoothness. While the T101 is 
being blown to pieces in the firefight, his clothing and outer flesh 
destroyed, the T1000 is only temporarily deformed, and flows 
elegantly back to his original shape, his hair undisturbed and his 
uniform well-pressed.

<p>In <i>Terminator 2</i>, hack technology is technology which is 
controllable. The renegades in the film are in control of their 
technology, and battle against the matte-black technology which 
controls them. They understand their machines; they can 
disassemble them and investigate them. The T101 Terminator is 
knowable--he has an outside and an inside which can be discovered 
(as we see when he dissects his hand to show to Miles Dyson)--and 
thus can be manipulated. Moreover, as John Connor discovers, he 
obeys orders. He represents technology as a tool, an extension of 
human willfulness. The "liquid metal" T1000, on the other hand, is 
inscrutable, presenting an unbreakable silver facade. He cannot be 
taken apart; when his body is frozen and shattered in the steel 
factory, the pieces continue to exhibit organized behavior, and rejoin 
one another. The film thus expresses a polarity between knowledge 
and secrecy, and aligns knowledge with hack technology against the 
secrecy of matte-black technology. John learns his hacking skills 
from Sarah--she disseminates technical information to him--and the 
our source of technical information about the T1000 and the history 
of the future is the "detailed files" of the T101 Terminator. But the 
technology of authority involves secrecy: doors, locks, keys, and the 
panopticon-like surveillance cameras, as well as the stealthy and 
unknown T1000. The renegades' means of control is knowledge, 
while the authorities use secrecy and the withholding of knowledge 
for control.

<p>Hack technology is valorized over matte-black technology 
because it is the province of the good guys: the Connors and the 
T101. So there is good technology and bad technology, and the film's 
anti-technology message is refined through this distinction. 
Moreover, the good guys are the renegades, and the authority figures 
are enemies. The film's message thus has a political component, 
valuing a libertarian and anti-authoritarian ideal of personal 
freedom and knowledge. <i>Terminator 2</i> explores the fear that 
technology will lead to loss of freedom, loss of control and loss of 
knowledge, while acknowledging that all of these qualities can be 
enhanced through technological means. The conflict is not expressly 
man against machine, but machines under human control versus 
machines out of control, machines under their own control. This 
specific fear of a self-controlled machine is played out in the 
references to artificial intelligence: we find out that SkyNet is based 
on a neural net processor, a "learning computer," and that it 
"becomes self-aware." The threat, as in Frankenstein, is a machine 
which no longer obeys its creator, and in fact replaces it.

<p>The hack technologists in <i>Terminator 2</i> take their place next to 
the heroes of television shows such as Macgyver and The A-Team as 
creative, constructive people building things out of the recycled trash 
of the modern era; they use technology not as it was intended to be 
used but instead as they choose to use it, and save the day through 
their efforts. They are the masters of their tech instead of its 
servants. They use technology (and they are technology) but they 
know what they are using and how it works.
