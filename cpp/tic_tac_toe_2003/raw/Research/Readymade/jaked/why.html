<h2>The why of the thing.</h2>

<p>Around January of 1994 I discovered the Web--Mosaic was just
getting big--and was quickly hooked: I put up a server and started
publishing Nadine Magazine online. After college I got a job at
Oracle, where my work was easy and boring, and I had time to do
whatever I wanted (within the confines of an 8x8 cubicle). I started
playing around with dynamic HTML and doing cool hacks on Oracle's
internal Web (which was really taking off around then--without
management support of course).

<p>Eventually I decided that it would be cool to have a generalized
tool for writing dynamic HTML. The documentation group on my floor
used FrameMaker, and they could embed Lisp code in their documents
which would parameterize the documents in various ways. I'd studied
interpreters in college and was fascinated with Scheme, so in January
of 1995 I started working on a Scheme system designed to be a
preprocessor for HTML. Its design criteria were that it be small (for
painless forking) and extensible (to ease interfacing with other
systems).

<p>My job at Oracle stayed boring but became less easy, so in July of
1995 I left for <b>vivid</b> studios, where I could hack the web
full-time. Now my job was hard and interesting, which beats easy and
boring (and hard and boring hands down). I didn't have as much hacking
time as I would have liked but in little bursts over the next year I
"finished" the preprocessor (in some asymptotic sense). I tried to get
people interested in it at <b>vivid</b> but that didn't work out.

<p>Work got really crazy and the code languished. In the meantime, a
bunch of other similar systems had come out (PHP/FI, htxp, Webgen,
Dynamo, Meta-HTML, others). I became interested in other projects and
stopped working on <b>hpp</b>.

<p>At this point the market for HTML preprocessors seems saturated
(and probably short-lived). The market for Scheme systems is full as
well--there are good small Schemes and good extensible Schemes. So I'm
releasing this code a) to show to prospective employers and b) so
people can poke around in a relatively simple and clean Scheme
implementation.

<p>I have no plans to develop <b>hpp</b> further, but I'm willing to
help you out if you want to do so.
